2. Study GAN

3. Read and summarize the following papers:
- [Colorization using CNN](http://hi.cs.waseda.ac.jp/~iizuka/projects/colorization/en/).
- [Colorization using GAN](https://www.dropbox.com/home/photo-coloring/Papers/Karim%20El%20Ghazouly/Colorization%20using%20GAN?preview=1803.05400.pdf).

4. Find source code and proper implementation for the above two papers, understand it, and learn how to learn and enhance it. 

5. Search for good resources to study and learn GAN and CNN, and share it with others.
